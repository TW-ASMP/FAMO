### [[üë©üèª‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èdecision]] on how we import current data values from the data sources
initiative:: #[[initiative/datahub/data load]] 
fully-executed::
tentative:: no
still-relevant:: yes
review-on-date::
	- MK asked: Can we settle on some simple rules for determining the "Current" property values for now? Suggest we define these based on property type and data store
	- In the meeting, we agreed on
		- 1. the current value of each property comes from a single data source, IF THERE ARE 2 DATA SOURCES REPRESENTING THE SAME PROPERTY, MEGAN IS GOING TO ASSUME THAT THE CURRENT VALUE IS ALWAYS FOUND IN ONE SYSTEM.
		- 2. we are selecting some way of identifying the current manif, (this is not meant to be permanent way can change in the future).
