- Had [[TopQuadrant]] implied that transitivity was going to be handled exclusively through SPARQL? and there is no way to defined that in the model? I feel like this is really losing something - you are leaving out the fundamental nature of a property from the model, and leaving it to be defined solely through SPARQL.
