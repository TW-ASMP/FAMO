	- ### [[👩🏻‍⚖️decision]] on prioritization of Terry's work (no filter implementation) 
	  initiative:: [[initiative/datahub/UI]] 
	  tentative:: no
	  fully-executed::
	  still-relevant:: yes
	  review-on-date:: [[Aug 28th, 2023]]
		- Sequence of work
			- Higher priority
				- Hierarchy editing - added or moving roles
				- 2nd view of hierarchy (to assist with hierarchy editing pinning and unpinning)
				- ability to make correction to values and view these corrections
			- ---
			- Lower priority
				- Field reconciliation features
					- comment: should be very simple
				- pinning and unpinning
		- I asked Terry to stop working on filter function
		- For now, our objective is to have a  "reference implementation" - we already have that.
		- but further work will depend on dataset specification, which we do not have.

	  embedded-in-mind:: no

		- No matter which technology is being considered for implementation, the new developer really needs to think about a fool proof way of syncing the UI view with the database
