[?p1, rdf:type, famo:CurrentPropertyManifestation] :- [?p1, rdf:type, famo:PropertyManifestation], NOT EXISTS ?p2 IN ([?p1, change:hasNextManifestation, ?p2]).

## TO DO: refactor rules (here and SWRL) so that we have "latest property manifestation" in all data systems/orderings, and then "current property manifestation, based on being instantiated in a *particular* system", then re-write property-specific rules based only on current property manifestation status (i.e. no need to include the datasystem condition there)
