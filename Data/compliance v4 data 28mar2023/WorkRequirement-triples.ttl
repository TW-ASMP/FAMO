1. Missing or illegible sling identification. If the tag is missing or illegible, the inspector should remove the sling from service and send it to the manufacturer for current or updated certification, tagging, and testing.
2. Broken Wires: For strand-laid grommets and single-part slings, ten randomly distributed broken wires in one rope lay, or five broken wires in one strand in one rope lay. For cable laid, cable laid grommets and multi-part slings, use the following:
How to Inspect Wire Rope Slings According to ASME B30.9 Standards: Broken Wires Chart
3. Distortion: Kinking, crushing, birdcaging or other damage which distorts the rope structure. The main thing to look for is wires or strands that are pushed out of their original positions in the rope.
4. Heat Damage: Any metallic discoloration, fusing of wires or loss of internal lubricant caused by exposure to heat.
5. Damaged End Attachments: Cracked, bent or broken end fittings caused by abuse, wear or damage.
6. Bent Hooks: No more than 5 percent over the normal throat openings, measured at the narrowest point from the plane of the unbent hook (see ASME B30.10 Hooks).
7. Corrosion: Severe corrosion of the rope or end attachments which has caused pitting or binding of wires should be cause for replacing the sling. Light surface rust does not substantially affect strength of a sling.
8. Pulled Eye Splices: Any evidence that eye splices have slipped, tucked strands have moved or pressed sleeves show serious damage may be sufficient cause to reject a sling.
9. Unbalance: A very common cause of damage is the kink which results from pulling through a loop while using a sling, thus causing wires and strands to be deformed and pushed out of their original position. This unbalances the sling, reducing its strength.
10. Kinks: Are tightened loops with permanent strand distortion that result from improper handling when a rope is being installed or while in service. A kink happens when a loop is permitted to form and then is pulled down tight, causing permanent distortion of the strands. The damage is irreparable and the sling must be taken out of service.
11. Doglegs: Are permanent bends caused by improper use or handling. If the dogleg is severe, the sling must be removed from service. If the dogleg is minor, (exhibiting no strand distortion) and cannot be observed when the sling is under tension, the area of the minor dogleg should be marked for observation and the sling can remain in service.""";

imaging. Scan all electrical connections, contacts, and energized components.
At the end of the 60 min load test (Item 2 c), Table 3), with the emergency power supply system (all
components) still operating under at least 40% load, perform infrared thermal imaging of all components from
the point where the load bank cables will be connected (for the 2 h full load test), through to and including the
load side of each transfer switch. Scan all electrical connections, contacts, circuit breakers, and energized
components.
After at least 60 min of the emergency generator full load test (see Clause 11.3), with the emergency generator
still operating under full load, conduct infrared thermal imaging of all components from the load terminals of
each alternator through to the connection point for the load bank cables. Scan all electrical connections,
contacts, circuit breakers, and energized components.
Correct any components or connections that displayed unacceptably high temperatures or unacceptable
differences in temperature between phases, during the tests in Items a), b), and c) above.
Repeat the infrared thermal imaging for any components and connections that were serviced, repaired, or
replaced following the scans performed in Items a), b), or c) above.
9. Lubricate door locks and hinges (if necessary), especially those of outdoor enclosures.
10. Conduct a 2 h full load test (see Clause 11.3).
11. As needed, review and provide instruction on the technical requirements specified in Tables 2 to 4 with the
person(s) responsible for carrying out the work.
12. Correct all defects found during inspections and tests.
13. Record all inspections, tests, and corrective actions in the log (see Clause 11.5.3).""";

Notes:
1) Recommended field test procedures are provided in Annex A.
2) For the purposes of this Clause, the term \"stabilized\" means that the gouge reading can be fluctuating but not descending.
8.1 PVB devices
8.1.1 General 
To be recorded as \"passed\", a PVB device shall comply with the requirements of Clauses 8.1.2, 8.1.3, and 8.1.4. If \"failed\" is recorded in one or more of these tests, the PVB device shall be recorded as \"failed\". The test results shall be recorded as specified in Clause 4.3.1 (see Table 1).
8.1.2 Air inlet valve
8.1.2.1 Requirements
The air inlet valve shall begin to open when the internal pressure in the PVB device is at least 6.9 kPa higher than atmospheric pressure and shall be fully open when the water drains from the PVB device.
8.1.2.2
Pass/fail criteria if the air inlet valve begins to open when the internal pressure in the PVB device is at least 6.9 kPa higher than atmospheric pressure and is fully open when the water drains from the PVB device, the test shall be recorded as \"opened/passed\".
if one or both requirements are not met, the test shall be recorded as \"failed to open/failed\".
8.1.3 Check valve
8.1.3.1 Requirements The check valve shall close tight for a minimum period of 2 min or until the gauge reading stabilizes, in the direction of flow, when the inlet pressure is at least 6.9 kPa higher than the outlet pressure.
8.1.3.2 Pass/fail criteria If the check valve closes tight for a minimum period of 2 min or until the gauge reading stabilizes, in the direction of flow, when the inlet pressure is at least 6.9 kPa higher than the outlet pressure, the test shall be recorded as \"closed tight/passed\".
if the check valve does not close tight for a minimum period of 2 min or until the gauge reading stabilizes, the test shall be recorded as \"leaked/failed\".
8.1.4 Static line pressure
8.1.4.1 Requirements The static inlet line pressure shall be measured at the time of the test and recorded on the test report form.
8.1.4.2 Pass/fail criteria if the static inlet line pressure at the time of testing is a) recorded on the test report form, the test shall be recorded as \"passed\"; and b) not recorded on the test report form, the test shall be recorded as \"failed\".
