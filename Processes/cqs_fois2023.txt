CQ 1: Given a record,  has a (designated) person made an interpretation of what it refers to?

SELECT ?agent ?entity WHERE {
<given record> rmo:hasInterpretation ?i.
?i rmo:denotes ?entity.
?a a rmo:interpretation;
	rmo:leadsToInterpretation ?i.
?agent rmo:performs ?a.
}

CQ 2: Given an interpretable record, does the object that it refers to observed to actually exist?
Note: this formalization relies on a classification from the domain ontology of an entity as an "actual thing" (e.g. vs some non-real object)
ASK {
<given record> rmo:hasInterpretation ?i.
?i rmo:denotes ?entity.
?entity a <Actual Thing>.
}

CQ 3: Given an interpretable record, is a given recorded property value consistent with observation? Who had performed the observation, and when was it made?
Note: there are variations of this formalization depending on how the property manifestation subclass is defined
SELECT ?rec_val ?obs_val ?agent ?time WHERE {
<given record> rmo:representsSubjectOf ?p_rec.
?p rmo:hasValue ?rec_val.

<field observation> rmo:finds ?p_obs.
?p_obs rmo:hasValue ?obs_val.
?agent rmo:performs <field observation>.
<field observation> rmo:occursAt ?time.
}

CQ 4: Given an object, is it missing its record or does it have duplicate records in a given source?
Part 1: is it missing its record?
ASK {
	?rec rmo:hasInterpretation [rmo:denotes <given object>];
		rmo:instantiatedIn <given source>.}
		
Part 2: does it have duplicate records?
ASK {
	?rec1 rmo:hasInterpretation [rmo:denotes <given object>];
	?rec2 rmo:hasInterpretation [rmo:denotes <given object>];
		rmo:instantiatedIn <given source>.
	FILTER (?rec1 != ?rec2)}

CQ 5: Given an object bearing a certain property, what was the recorded value of the property at time t?
Note: formalization shown for a data property. 
SELECT ?val_t WHERE {
	?rec rmo:hasInterpretation [rmo:denotes <given object>];
		rmo:representsSubjectOf ?p.
	?p a <given property>;
		rmo:validAt <t>;
		rmo:hasValue ?val_t.
		}
		UNION {
	?rec rmo:hasInterpretation [rmo:denotes <given object>];
		rmo:representedSubjectOf ?p.
	?p a <given property>;
		rmo:validAt <t>;
		rmo:hasValue ?val_t.
		}

CQ 6: Given an object bearing a certain property, what was the change process that led to that property value?
Formalized for "current property value"
SELECT ?a WHERE {
	?rec rmo:hasInterpretation [rmo:denotes <given object>];
		rmo:representsSubjectOf ?p.
	?p a <given property>.
	?a rmo:hasOutcomeProperty ?p.
	}

CQ 7: Given a change process, who performed the process and when?
SELECT ?agent ?time WHERE {
	?agent rmo:performs <given process>.
	<given process> rmo:occursAt ?time.}
